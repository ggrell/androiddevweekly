#### [Done & Discard](https://plus.google.com/113735310430199015092/posts/R49wVvcDoEW)
From Roman Nurik:
> There's a visual pattern in some system apps where the Up button is replaced by a Done button, optionally with an adjacent or overflow'd Discard negative action. I personally think this pattern works really well within the framework of—and in the spirit of—the guidelines, so I decided to open source some code showing how to do it.

#### [Undo Bar](https://plus.google.com/113735310430199015092/posts/RA9WEEGWYp6)
Again from Roman Nurik:
> As a follow up to yesterday's post (above) about Done and Discard, I realized we didn't have great sample code for an undo bar (ala Gmail). This is a bar that shows up after a potentially destructive or heavyweight action is performed (e.g. archiving or deleting an email) and briefly offers the ability to undo the most recent action.
