#### [Spoon - Distributing instrumentation tests to all your Androids](http://square.github.com/spoon/)
Android's ever-expanding ecosystem of devices creates a unique challenge to testing applications. Spoon aims to simplify this task by distributing instrumentation test execution and displaying the results in a meaningful way.

Instead of attempting to be a new form of testing, Spoon makes existing instrumentation tests more useful. Using the application APK and instrumentation APK, Spoon runs the tests on multiple devices simultaneously. Once all tests have completed, a static HTML summary is generated with detailed information about each device and test. (via [Ketan Parmar](http://kpbird.blogspot.in/))

#### [Video: Deep Dive into Android IPC/Binder Framework at AnDevCon IV](http://marakana.com/s/post/1340/deep_dive_into_android_ipc_binder_framework_at_andevcon_iv)
Aleksandar Gargenta talks about Inter Process Communication (IPC), which has been a part of Android since 1.0, and yet most of us take it for granted. Intents, content providers, and system service managers hide the IPC infrastructure provided by Binder, but without it, the Android OS and our apps would simply fall apart. Binder/IPC is the glue that holds it all together. It enables Android's memory management, security sandboxing, efficient threading, and countless other features on the Android platform.
