#### [Complete Rewrite of aFileChoose Library](https://github.com/iPaulPro/aFileChooser)
[Paul Burke](https://plus.google.com/113406723988623654387) has rewritten his open source file chooser library. Here are some details:

>Android developers often desire a way to present a user with a method of selecting a file from "external" storage. Android's Intent system gives developers the ability to implicitly hook into other app's components, but if the user doesn't have a file explorer installed, the developer must instruct them to install one, or build one, themselves.

> aFileChooser is an Android Library Project that simplifies this process.
