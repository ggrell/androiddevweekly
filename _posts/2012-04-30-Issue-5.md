#### [10 Eclipse Navigation Shortcuts Every Java Programmer Should Know](http://rayfd.wordpress.com/2007/05/20/10-eclipse-navigation-shortcuts-every-java-programmer-should-know/)

## Open Source Project of the Week
#### [RoboGuice 2.0](http://code.google.com/p/roboguice/)
This is one of those indispensable Android libraries that you will find yourself using in most if not all of your projects. The new 2.0 version now comes with full support for Fragments, among many other changes and improvements. From the website:
> RoboGuice 2 smoothes out some of the wrinkles in your Android development experience and makes things simple and fun. Do you always forget to check for null when you getIntent().getExtras()? RoboGuice 2 will help you. Think casting findViewById() to a TextView shouldn’t be necessary? RoboGuice 2 is on it.

> RoboGuice 2 takes the guesswork out of development. Inject your View, Resource, System Service, or any other object, and let RoboGuice 2 take care of the details.

> RoboGuice 2 slims down your application code. Less code means fewer opportunities for bugs. It also makes your code easier to follow -- no longer is your code littered with the mechanics of the Android platform, but now it can focus on the actual logic unique to your application.

> There’s no “magic”. Everything you need is configured explicitly for you by RoboGuice 2 or can be overridden by you.

## Code

#### [TextView Inner Shadows with EmbossMaskFilter](http://wiresareobsolete.com/wordpress/2012/04/textview-inner-shadows/)
Here's a great blog post on how to create a nice embossed text effect in code, brought to you by Dave Smith. The standard TextView only allows for a drop shadow, so this technique uses the poorly documented EmbossMaskFilter (and Dave does a great job explaining its use.)

#### [Google Code: Little Fluffy Location Library](http://code.google.com/p/little-fluffy-location-library/)
Battery-friendly background location updates for Android! Drop this tiny library into your Android app, configure your manifest, initialise it in your application's onCreate method... and that's it!

Location updates will be broadcast to your app periodically, including after phone reboot. And your users won't complain about it killing their batteries.

## Design
#### [Augmented Paper](http://mattgemmell.com/2012/04/13/augmented-paper)
Here's a wonderful analysis of the different designs and user experience across iOS, Windows Phone and Android. Matt Gemmell also discusses something that I tend to lean toward as well, which are "Invisible Interfaces." I think we'll be seeing more of this as people start to learn more about gestures, and let a lot more of the traditional user interface get out of the way. ([#](http://iosdevweekly.com/issues/38))
