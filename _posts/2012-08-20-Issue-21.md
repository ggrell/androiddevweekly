## Open Source Project of the Week

#### [SpongyCastle](http://rtyley.github.com/spongycastle/)
The Android platform unfortunately incorporates a cut-down version of Bouncy Castle - as well as being crippled, it also makes installing an updated version of the libraries difficult due to classloader conflicts.

Spongy Castle is the stock Bouncy Castle libraries with a couple of small changes to make it work on Android:

* all package names have been moved from **org.bouncycastle.* ** to **org.spongycastle.* ** - to avoid classloader conflicts
* the Java Security API Provider name is now **SC** rather than **BC**
* no class names change, so the BouncyCastleProvider class remains Bouncy, not Spongy, but moves to the **org.spongycastle.jce.provider** package.

Augmented reality (AR) offers a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment, where the elements and surroundings are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as graphics and GPS data. It makes a game more real. Your social media app puts you where want to be or go. 

Pro Android Augmented Reality walks you through the foundations of building an augmented reality application. From using various software and Android hardware sensors, such as an accelerometer or a magnetometer (compass), you'll learn the building blocks of augmented reality for both marker- and location-based apps. 

Case studies are included in this one-of-a-kind book, which pairs nicely with other Android development books. After reading Pro Android Augmented Reality, you'll be able to build augmented reality rich media apps or integrate all the best augmented reality into your favorite Android smartphone and/or tablet.
