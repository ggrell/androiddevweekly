#### [New award at The Tactrick Android Developer Cup](http://devcup.tactrick.com)
Qualcomm invites Android-developers to create innovative apps that use the AllJoyn SDK from Qualcomm Innovation Center, Inc. AllJoyn is an open-source application development framework, enabling real-time content sharing and interaction between applications, devices and people, regardless of OS platforms and device types.

You can [submit your app now](http://devcup.tactrick.com/). One developer will be awarded with $3,000 in cash for the best AllJoyn concept and get an invitation to discuss potential support on AllJoyn app development and promotion.

#### [nightWeb](http://nightweb.net)
Nightweb connects your Android device to an anonymous, peer-to-peer social network. You can write posts and share photos, and your followers will retrieve them using BitTorrent running over the I2P anonymous network. It is still experimental and not well-tested, but the goal is to have uncensorable, untraceable communication and file-sharing on mobile devices.

**Why Android?**

The goal of Nightweb is to be a "killer app" for anonymous networking; to make it a more mainstream technology. With this in mind, it is important to go where the users are going, which is mobile. Android is the best mobile OS for this, because (1) it allows generic, long-running background services, (2) it is API-compatible with Java so I2P runs on it perfectly, and (3) it allows sideloading apps, so the app can always be distributed.

**Why Clojure?**

Clojure is more fun to code in than Java, which is an important quality for projects I am not paid to work on. The Android API and the I2P project are written in Java, but Clojure interops with them easily. Its biggest pragmatic benefit is that it simplifies concurrency. This isn't a big deal right now, since Clojure is primarily being used on the frontend, but it will pay big dividends later if I need to rewrite parts of the I2P backend.

#### [Two New Annotations For Simpler Code](https://plus.google.com/u/0/102164807080986038267/posts/ik2LLa4hwH2)
Since annotation processing is the new hip thing to do, [Hugo Visser](https://plus.google.com/u/0/102164807080986038267) has decided to jump on the bandwagon! He wrote two annotation processors to make our life simpler. The first one deals with Fragment instantiation and arguments. The second one helps flag fields for automatically saving and restoring fields via onSaveInstanceState/onCreate.

#### [Android Intents with Chrome](https://developers.google.com/chrome/mobile/docs/intents)
