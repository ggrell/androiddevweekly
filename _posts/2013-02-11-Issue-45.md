#### [Introducing Amazon Coins: A New Virtual Currency for Kindle Fire](http://www.amazonappstoredev.com/2013/02/introducing-amazon-coins.html)
Amazon announced the upcoming launch of Amazon Coins, a new virtual currency for U.S. customers to purchase apps, games, and in-app items on Kindle Fire. When Amazon Coins launches in May, they will be giving out tens of millions of dollars worth of Coins to customers to spend on Kindle Fire apps, games, or in-app items
To take advantage of this unique opportunity, you only need to do one thing: make sure your new apps and app updates are submitted and approved by April 25th so they'll have the best chance of being available for Coins purchases at the launch of the program (and when we give customers their free Coins).
