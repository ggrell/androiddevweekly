#### [Localize your apps and content more easily with Google Translator Toolkit](http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2012/03/localize-your-apps-and-content-more.html)
Google Translator Toolkit is an online translation tool for amateur and professional translators -- itâ€™s built on Google Translate and supports more than 100,000 language pairs. This week, the Translator Toolkit team has launched support for four new translation-related file formats: 

*   Android Resource (.xml)
*   Application Resource Bundle (.arb)
*   Chrome Extension (.json)
*   GNU gettext-based (.po)

With these new file formats, you can use Translator Toolkit to localize your apps and other products and content much more quickly and easily.
