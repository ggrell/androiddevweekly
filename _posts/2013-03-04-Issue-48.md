#### [Google+ Sign-In Now Part of Google Play Services](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/02/google-sign-in-now-part-of-google-play.html)
Google Play Services is a platform for offering you better integration with Google products, and providing new capabilities to use within your apps. They’re rolling out Google Play services v3.0, which includes Google+ Sign-In and Google Maps Android API improvements.

Google+ Sign-In lets users sign in to your Android app with their existing Google credentials, and bring along their Google+ info for an upgraded experience. In addition to basic authentication, today’s release includes features that can accelerate both app downloads and engagement.

## Tools

#### [Robolectric 2.0 alpha 2](http://robolectric.blogspot.de/2013/02/robolectric-20-alpha-2.html)
As before, this release is alpha-quality, and targeted at early adopters. Expect that there'll be bugs, and APIs are expected to change before final release. Please use this alpha only if you can deal with some churn.

Changes since alpha 1:

* Classes in the android support lib are now fully enabled without the use of shadows.
* Resource loading is better than ever. Library project support is much more robust.
* Internally we've switched from Javassist to ASM for the bytecode manipulation that works Robolectric's magic. This and a couple other optimizations give us a huge performance win: one project's test suite here at Square dropped from 163 seconds to 76.
* We report our Build.VERSION.SDK_INT as 8 (Froyo) for now.
Should get along well with ActionBarSherlock.

## Open Source Project of the Week

#### [ListViewAnimations](https://bitbucket.org/nhaarman/listviewanimations)

[Niek Haarman](https://plus.google.com/106017817931984343451)'s ListViewAnimations is an Open Source Android library that allows developers to easily create ListViews with animations. Feel free to use it all you want in your Android apps provided that you cite this project and include the license in your app.
ListViewAnimations uses the NineOldAndroids library to support devices <3.0.
It also uses Roman Nurik's BETA `SwipeDismissListViewTouchListener` to support swipe to dismiss.

This library uses the Decorator Pattern to stack multiple `AnimationAdapter`s on each other:

* Implement your own `BaseAdapter`, or reuse an existing one.
* Stack multiple `BaseAdapterDecorators` on each other, with your `BaseAdapter` as a base.
* Set the `ListView` to your last `BaseAdapterDecorator`.
* Set your last `BaseAdapterDecorator` to the `ListView`.

#### [Herding HTTP Requests](http://mttkay.github.com/blog/2013/03/02/herding-http-requests-or-why-your-keep-alive-connection-may-be-dead/)
One of the more expensive things you can do on Android, or mobile in general, is sending and receiving data over a mobile network connection. Holding a dedicated channel in particular causes high battery consumption, as much as a hundred times more compared to being idle. Moreover, there is overhead on various levels when establishing a dedicated connection. [Matthias Käppler](https://plus.google.com/u/0/112265135089213955243) writes about issues he ran into with `HTTPURLConnection` and his solutions.

#### [Recycling objects in Android with an Object Pool to avoid garbage collection](http://www.devahead.com/blog/2011/12/recycling-objects-in-android-with-an-object-pool-to-avoid-garbage-collection/)
If you need to reduce the work of the garbage collector in Android, like in games development for example, all you can do is reduce the amount of objects you create and recycle those you’ve already created. One of the ways to do this is the implementation of the Object Pool design pattern.

#### [Refreshing Android permissions](http://evancharlton.com/thoughts/refreshing-permissions)
[Evan Charlton](https://plus.google.com/108615254983735704342) had an idea on how developers can work around [a limitation of Android's permission system](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=25906). Specifically, the issue is around protecting a resource with permissions, and what to do if the app providing permissions isn't installed yet.

#### [Mastering the Android Developer Tools: Working with Layout Tools, DDMS, AVD, and ADT](http://amzn.to/XO5QnE)
<img src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920025320/cat.gif" style="float: right; margin: 1em;" /> 

Developing Android apps is a challenge: it's hard enough to write high-performing apps that run well, but you've also got to make them look good on a wide variety of Android devices.

Fortunately, there are a many tools that take the pain out of developing Android, but they don't readily give up their secrets.

To help with your user interface, the Android Graphical Layout Tools make laying out complicated Activities easy, and the HierarchyViewer does a great job of identifying complexity in your layouts. To help identify memory or resource issues you can use the Dalvik Debug Manager Service (DDMS) tools, which include TraceView and AllocationTracker. These make it easy to understand exactly where your application is allocating resources. There are tools to help simulate devices: the Android Virtual Device (AVD) tools. Lastly, there is a rich set of plugins for a variety of Integrated Development Environments that help streamline the development process:the Android Developer Tools (ADT) plug-ins.

[Mike Wolfson](https://plus.google.com/114182988463720945996)'s book will guide you through the proper usage of all of these tools. It will describe in detail what each tool is designed to do, when and how to use them, and how to integrate them into your development workflow, making the development process less painful. This book will give you a better understanding of the variety of tools available, and empower your to design and deliver great Android Applications.
