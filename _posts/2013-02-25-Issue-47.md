## Open Source Project of the Week

#### [RoundedImageView](https://github.com/makeramen/RoundedImageView)

<img src="https://raw.github.com/makeramen/RoundedImageView/master/screenshot.png" style="float: right; margin: 1em; width:200px;" /> 

A fast ImageView (and Drawable) that supports rounded corners based on the [original example from Romain Guy](http://www.curious-creature.org/2012/12/11/android-recipe-1-image-with-rounded-corners/).

There are many ways to create rounded corners in android, but this is the fastest and best one because it:

* does not create a copy of the original bitmap
* does not use a clipPath which is not hardware accelerated and not anti-aliased.
* does not use setXfermode to clip the bitmap and draw twice to the canvas.

If you know of a better method, let the author know and he'll implement it!

Also has proper support for:

* Borders
* All `ScaleType`s
  * Borders are drawn at view edge, not bitmap edge.
  * Except on edges where the bitmap is smaller than the view
  * Borders are **not** scaled up/down with the image (correct width and radius are maintained)
* Anti-aliasing
* Transparent backgrounds
* Hardware acceleration
* Support for TransitionDrawables (XML attrs only)

Limitations:

* Does not round images set by .setImageResource(int resId). Use BitmapFactory and setImageBitmap() instead.
* Programmatically setting attributes with TransitionDrawables not yet supported.
* Only tested support for BitmapDrawables and TransitionDrawables (with BitmapDrawables in them). Other types might work but may have unexpected behavior.

[Chris Banes](https://plus.google.com/103829716466878605055) writes a quick solution to the following problem:

>I have a ListView populated from a CursorLoader. When I swap to a cursor with new items on top, I use setSelectionFromTop() to keep the ListView at the same visible position. Unfortunately the ListView changes position and flicks in between the calls.

## Books

#### [Beginning NFC: Near-Field Communication with Arduino, Android, and PhoneGap](http://amzn.to/15ecJkh)
<img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=144930852X&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=trickybits-20" style="float: right; margin: 1em;" /> 

NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a protocol for the contactless exchange of data between devices (such as the Android-powered Nexus S) and/or certain kinds of tags. NFC also interoperates with certain RFID tags such as the Mifare tags. Where the fun begins is when you throw hobbyist hardware into the mix. The inexpensive ($30) SonMicro RFID reader/writer, when paired with an equally inexpensive antenna, gives you the ability to encode custom messages on RFID tags that you can later read by tapping the tags against your phone. This book shows how you can exchange data between Android, Arduino, and Processing using NFC and RFID.

## Miscellaneous

#### [Video: A Deep Dive Into Mobile Malware](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI-7cZtOOWk)
Emil Ong works as an engineer for the security team at Lookout and provides firsthand information on mobile malware and ways to protect yourself from malware threats. In this presentation, hosted by the San Francisco Android User Group at Eventbrite, Emil gives an in-depth analysis on ways to keep your phone safe.

The talk cites examples of common malware threats (some of which include drive-by download, fake players, trojan apps) and includes a look at the code of certain harmful software.
