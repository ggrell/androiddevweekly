#### [Introducing Smoothie](http://lucasr.org/2013/01/06/introducing-smoothie/)
[Lucas Rocha](https://plus.google.com/117146991527827534089) has announced the Smoothie project, for helping make ListView/GridView item loading as smooth as possible. Smoothie provides a simple API to load ListView/GridView items asynchronously, off the UI thread. It does all the obvious things you’d expect—loading items as they become visible, cancelling item requests for recycled views, etc. But it does a bit more than that: it will avoid wasting item requests after a fling gesture and enable incremental item loading while you scroll the list with finger down. It also supports offscreen item preloading to reduce the number of placeholder-type items as you scroll.

[Charlie Collins](https://plus.google.com/105328255196448500543) spent a couple days during the holidays creating this app: 
>Pick a picture on your Android phone, and send it to your Google TV (or your other Android phone or tablet), with no setup at all. … The UI is minimal and ugly. Working on the UI and adding features like slideshows and such will come next. 

He's also shared the code on GitHub, so why don't we all fork the project and help out?
