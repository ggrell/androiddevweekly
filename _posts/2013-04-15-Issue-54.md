#### [New Look, New Purchase Flow in Google Play](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/04/new-look-new-purchase-flow-in-google.html)
Google announced that a new version of the Google Play Store app is rolling out worldwide to Android phones and tablets.

## Tools

#### [New bugreport analysis tool released as open source](http://developer.sonymobile.com/2012/01/25/new-bugreport-analysis-tool-released-as-open-source/)
Android developers, do you frequently get Application Not Responding (ANR) messages and application crashes? Are you unsure what to do with the massive data collected from Android’s bugreport tool? Pál Szász, a software developer at Sony Ericsson, shares ChkBugReport, a new tool that helps you analyse your crash files. Because this tool is such a great help for developers at Sony Ericsson, and as a part of their ambition to step up our open source activities, they want to give all of you the chance to use it by making it open source.

## Open Source Project of the Week

#### [RefreshActionItem](https://github.com/ManuelPeinado/RefreshActionItem)
<img src="https://raw.github.com/ManuelPeinado/RefreshActionItem/master/art/readme_pic.png" style="width:500px;" /> 

[Manuel Peinado Gallego](https://plus.google.com/106514622630861903655) has created an action bar item that implements this common pattern:

* Initially it shows a refresh button.
* If the button is clicked, a background operation begins and the button turns into a progress indicator.
* When the background operation ends, the button is restored to its initial state.

The progress bar shows a magnitude which represents how far the operation has proceeded. The progress bar can also be made indeterminate, just like the built-in ProgressBar.

It is possible to add a small badge to the action item. This tells the user that there is new data available.

Now he has release the Android UI Design Kit in Powerpoint format, created using Microsoft Powerpoint 2013 (Windows).

Note: It is meant to be used with Windows version of Microsoft Powerpoint. Nevertheless, it is usable on Powerpoint for Mac, although the font type used have to be replaced with the proper one (due to the different font naming system). It can also be used in Apple Keynote, however, you need to change the slide size to 768×1280 manually before the design and export the screen.

## Books

#### [The Business of Android Apps Development: Making and Marketing Apps that Succeed on Google Play, Amazon Appstore and More](http://amzn.to/10XzBkX)
<img src="http://www.apress.com/media/catalog/product/cache/9/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/A/9/A9781430250074-3d.png" style="float: right; margin: 1em;" /> 

The growing but still evolving success of the Android platform has ushered in a second mobile technology “gold rush” for app developers.  Google Play and Amazon Appstore for Android apps has become the second go-to apps eco for today's app developers.  While not yet as large in terms of number of apps as iTunes, Google Play and Amazon Appstore have so many apps that it has become increasingly difficult for new apps to stand out in the crowd. Achieving consumer awareness and sales longevity for your Android app requires a lot of organization and some strategic planning.

Written for today's Android apps developer or apps development shop, this new and improved book from Apress, The Business of Android Apps Development, Second Edition, tells you today's story on how to make money on Android apps.  This book shows you how to take your app from idea to design to development to distribution and marketing your app on Google Play or Amazon Appstore. 

This book takes you step-by-step through cost-effective marketing, public relations and sales techniques that have proven successful for professional Android app creators and indie shops—perfect for independent developers on shoestring budgets.  It even shows you how to get interest from venture capitalists and how they view a successful app vs. the majority of so-so to unsuccessful apps in Android.  No prior business knowledge is required. This is the book you wish you had read before you launched your first app!
