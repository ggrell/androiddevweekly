#### [In-app Subscriptions in Google Play](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/05/in-app-subscriptions-in-google-play.html)
In-app subscriptions have now been enabled in the Play market.

#### [Android's Overblown Fragmentation Problem](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4008472)
I think we can all agree that there are potentially more issues in supporting hundreds of Android devices, versus a few on iOS, but the extent of those issues really depend on the type of application you're developing. Most apps will have none, or very few problems. Be sure to read the original blog post by Nick Bradbury, then the comments on Hacker News.

## Open Source Project of the Week

#### [Mark Murphy's (aka CommonsGuy) Android libraries on GitHub](https://github.com/commonsguy)
Mark Murphy has been incredibly active and helpful to the Android community over the years, and has released many libraries that I've often found useful for my projects. Check out his projects on GitHub, and be sure to sign up for a subscription (it's a bargain) to his Android development ebooks on the [CommonsWare](http://commonsware.com/) site.

His newest library, [CWAC LoaderEx](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-loaderex#cwac-loaderex-taking-loaders-to-the-next-level), provides new implementation of Loaders beyond the single CursorLoader that the framework provides. Some of the new Loaders include SQLiteCursorLoader and SharedPreferencesLoader.

## Miscellaneous

cyrilmottier: Null your ViewStub references after being inflated (mViewStub = null). It lets the GC garbage it and saves memory. ([#](http://twitter.com/cyrilmottier/statuses/206009115036762112))

romainguy: With [the ViewServer class](https://t.co/GMH0PmaJ) & HierarchyViewer you can export your running app's UI as a PSD file for easy mock/debug ([#](http://twitter.com/romainguy/statuses/206089804201476097))

romainguy: Targeting API level 14 and above? Give TextureView a try, it's a SurfaceView that can scroll, animate, etc.  ([#](http://twitter.com/romainguy/statuses/204718216164016130))

romainguy: Don't call ListView.invalidateViews(), it blows away the cache of recycled views. This call is very expensive. ([#](http://twitter.com/romainguy/statuses/204680490748362752))

romainguy: To easily animate Views with #Android 3.2+, use View.animate(). For instance, to move & fade out: view.animate().x(500).alpha(0) ([#](http://twitter.com/romainguy/statuses/204678660056297473))
