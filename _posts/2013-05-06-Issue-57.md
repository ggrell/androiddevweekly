#### [Showing Our Android Community Developer Love in May](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2013/04/25/showing-our-android-community-developer-love-in-may/)
Facebook is becoming quite active in the Android developers community. They're throwing a party at Google I/O this year, as well as participating heavily in AnDevCon in Boston.

## Tools

[Dmytro Danylyk]() writes about what makes IntelliJ a great IDE for Android development.

#### [Buck: An Android build tool](http://facebook.github.io/buck/)
Buck is a build system for Android ()by the engineers at Facebook) that encourages the creation of small, reusable modules consisting of code and resources.
Buck can help you do the following:

* Speed up your Android builds. Buck builds independent artifacts in parallel to take advantage of multiple cores. Further, it reduces incremental build times by keeping track of unchanged resources so that the minimal set of resources is rebuilt.
* Introduce ad-hoc build steps for building artifacts that are not supported out-of-the-box using the standard Ant build scripts for Android.
* Keep the logic for generating build rules in the build system instead of requiring a separate system to generate build files.
* Generate code-coverage metrics for your unit tests.
* Generate an IntelliJ project based on your build rules. This makes Buck ideal for both local development builds in an IDE as well as headless builds on a continuous integration machine.
* Make sense of your build dependencies.
* Understand what is going on under the hood when building an APK.

This release is the perfect way for developers to start adding some missing features to the original Google-provided mapping library. Today, Polaris v2 is just a wrapper around the Google Maps Android API v2 but could easily become a must-use library in the future. The project is just waiting for the community to help it grow.

#### [I wish I’d thought of that. Operation Starbucks](http://joshledgard.com/i-wish-id-thought-of-that-operation-starbucks/)
> At a large wooden table sat a man with a laptop. I’m sure you can picture that. But this man had a stack of Starbucks gift cards laid out neatly to form an arrow. The arrow pointed to an iPad that was being used as a sign. The sign read “Test my App and Coffee’s on Jim.”
