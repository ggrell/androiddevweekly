## Open Source Projects of the Week

#### [Otto](http://square.github.com/otto/)
Otto is an event bus designed to decouple different parts of your application while still allowing them to communicate efficiently. Forked from Guava, Otto adds unique functionality to an already refined event bus as well as specializing it to the Android platform.

#### [EventBus](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus)
EventBus is an Android optimized publish/subscribe event bus. A typical use case for Android apps is gluing Activities, Fragments, and background threads together. Conventional wiring of those elements often introduces complex and error-prone dependencies and life cycle issues. With EventBus propagating listeners through all participants (e.g. background service -> activity -> multiple fragments or helper classes) becomes deprecated. EventBus decouples event senders and receivers and thus simplifies communication between app components. Less code, better quality. And you don't need to implement a single interface!

#### [Presentation: The Fragment Transition](http://prezi.com/fh2uslbr1xs3/the-fragment-transition/)
[Corey Latislaw](https://plus.google.com/115756181955040594344)'s presentation from StrangeLoop about Fragments.
>Corey will show you techniques for starting a fresh project, renovating an existing Android code base, optimizing for tablets, and balancing use of new APIs, while remaining backward compatible. She has been using fragments as long as they have been around in the XfinityTV app as well as her personal projects. She’d never start a new project with out them!

<img src="https://raw.github.com/octo-online/robospice/master/gfx/Robospice-logo-white-background.png" style="float: right; margin: 1em; width: 20em" /> RoboSpice is a modular android library that makes writing asynchronous network requests easy.

Main features of RoboSpice:

* executes asynchronously (in a background AndroidService) network requests
* supports REST out of the box (using Spring Android).
* is strongly typed ! You make your requests using POJOs and you get POJOs as request results.
* enforce no constraints neither on POJOs used for requests nor on Activity classes you use in your projects
* caches results in Json with both Jackson and Gson, or Xml, or flat text files, or binary files, even using ORM Lite (still in beta)
* notifies your activities (or any other context) of the result of the network request if and only if they are still alive
* no memory leaks at all, like Android Loaders, unlike Android AsyncTasks
notifies your activities on their UI Thread
* uses a simple but robust exception handling model
* supports aggregation of different web services
* supports multi-threading of request executions
* is open source ;)
* and tested

> Well, there were just two things: call me a cheapskate, but I won't pay $30 for an accessory I think I can make myself; and most importantly, putting so much pressure on your phone's charging port may eventually damage it.
After hours of prototyping and testing, I fabricated an alternative that promises the flexibility of Une Bobine without the $30 price tag (and without the potential harm.) I'm calling it: La Bobina.
