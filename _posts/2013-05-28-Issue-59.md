#### [ADT 22 and Tools 22 Released](https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/recent/adt22andtools22released)
During Google I/O a new version of ADT 22, and Tools 22 was released. These changes include:

* Changed the structure of the SDK by adding a new build tool SDK Component, which is based on the existing platform-tools component. This change decouples the build tools versions from the IDE versions, allowing updates to the tools without requiring an IDE update.
* Updated tools to allow libraries to share the same package name as the applications that use them.
* Updated draw9patch tool to allow easier changing of markers.
Added new Lint checks, including checks for layout consistency, RelativeLayout siblings, Parcel creator, JavaScript interfaces, Service casting, quantity strings, manifest typos, orientation tags in layouts, overlapping names for 9-patches and images, and class existence checks.
* Updated build tools to sign applications using the BouncyCastle library instead of relying on Sun JVM specific APIs.
Released some of the Android tools into Maven Central to assist third-party tool developers. The following tools are available in the repository: manifest-merger, common/sdk_common, ddmlib, dvlib, layoutlib_api,sdklib, and lint.
* Added an experimental Gradle build export feature for moving projects into the Android Studio environment or for setting up command-line builds with Gradle.
