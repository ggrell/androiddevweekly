#### [Picasso by Square](https://github.com/square/picasso)
Picasso is a powerful image downloading and caching library for Android.

Images add much-needed context and visual flair to Android applications. Picasso allows for hassle-free image loading in your application—often in one line of code!

`Picasso.with(context).load("http://i.imgur.com/DvpvklR.png").into(imageView);`

Many common pitfalls of image loading on Android are handled automatically by Picasso:

* Handling ImageView recycling and download cancelation in an adapter.
* Complex image transformations with minimal memory use.
* Automatic memory and disk caching.

Learn Android App Development is a hands-on tutorial and useful reference. You'll quickly get up to speed and master the Android SDK and the Java that you need for your Android Apps. You will fid that Learn Android App Development is an all-in-one getting started guide to building your first Android smartphone or tablet apps!

The Android SDK offers powerful features, and this book is the fastest path to mastering them—and the rest of the Andorid SDK—for programmers with some experience who are new to Android smartphone and tablet apps development. Many books introduce the Android SDK, but very few explain how to develop apps optimally and soundly. This book teaches both core Java language concepts and how to wisely but rapidly employ the design patterns and logic using the Android SDK, which is based on Java APIs.

You'll also learn best practices that ensure your code will be efficient and perform well. An app that performs well and is well designed is likely to get you the best reviews on Google Play or Amazon Appstore, which in turn helps drive higher or better search results and perhaps more revenue.

Why spend months or years discovering the best ways to design and code Android apps when this book will show you how to do things the right way from the start?

* Get an accelerated but complete enough treatment of the core fundamentals of Java necessary to get you started.
* Design your first app using prototyping and other design methods as others in the industry now do.
* Build your first Android app using the code that you're given as you walk through this book.
* Finally, debug and distribute your first app on Google Play or other Android app store.
