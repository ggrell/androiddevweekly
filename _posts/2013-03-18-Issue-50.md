## Open Source Project of the Week

<img src="https://raw.github.com/47deg/android-swipelistview-sample/master/screenshot_swipelistview_small.png" style="float: right; margin: 1em; height: 300px;" /> 

SwipeListView was born out of the need to add swipe gestures to ListView on Android for @ 47 Degrees Clients. Contributions and constructive feedback are welcome.

If you decide to use SwipeListView as a view, you can define it in your xml layout like this:

    <com.fortysevendeg.android.swipelistview.SwipeListView

            android:id="@+id/example_lv_list"
            android:listSelector="#00000000"
            android:layout_width="fill_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            swipe:swipeFrontView="@+id/front"
            swipe:swipeBackView="@+id/back"
            swipe:swipeActionLeft="[reveal | dismiss]"
            swipe:swipeActionRight="[reveal | dismiss]"
            swipe:swipeMode="[none | both | right | left]"
            swipe:swipeCloseAllItemsWhenMoveList="[true | false]"
