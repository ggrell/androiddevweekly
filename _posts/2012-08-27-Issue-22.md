## News

#### [Apple vs. Samsung: the verdict](http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/24/3266439/samsung-apple-verdict)
From The Verge:
> After a surprisingly short time, the jury in the Apple v. Samsung case has sent word that it's reached a verdict. The jury ruled overwhelmingly in favor of Apple, and awarded the company more than a billion dollars in damages. It's hard to see an upside for Samsung in all of this, but keep checking here for all our coverage of the case.

#### [NASA To Build Mini-Satellites Base On Nexus One Phones](http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/crosscutting_capability/edison/phonesat_prt.htm)
NASA's PhoneSat project will demonstrate the ability to launch the lowest-cost and easiest to build satellites ever flown in space – capabilities enabled by using off-the-shelf consumer smartphones to build spacecraft.

NASA's prototype smartphone satellite, known as PhoneSat 1.0, is built around the Nexus One smartphone made by HTC Corp., running Google's Android operating system.

NASA's PhoneSat 2.0 will equip a newer Nexus S smartphone made by Samsung Electronics running Google's Android operating system to provide a faster core processor, avionics and gyroscopes. 

#### [TechHub SF - Android Dev Dive](http://techubsfaugust.eventbrite.com/)
On Tuesday, Aug. 28th, Flurry will be hosting a meetup to go over everything you need to know to get started including tips, tricks and benchmarks to reach optimal performance. They’ll look at continuous integration and automated android builds, and testing of android devices out in the wild.  They’ve pulled together a panel of developer experts from across the app industry to describe their testing Dos and Don'ts. 

## Tools

#### [ADT 21 Preview 2 Available](http://tools.android.com/download/adt-21-preview)
Great new features and bug fixes coming soon in ADT 21. You can test them out with the latest Preview 2 release.

## Open Source Project of the Week

#### [Android-BitmapMemoryCache](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-BitmapMemoryCache)
From [Chris Banes](https://plus.google.com/103829716466878605055):
> This project came about as part of my [blog post](http://www.senab.co.uk/2012/07/01/android-bitmap-caching-revisited/).
> The basic premise is a LruCache used for Bitmap management on Android. Each Bitmap is reference counted, both my ImageViews and the Cache. When the bitmap is no longer being used or cached, it is recycled and the memory freed.
> I have added a sample app to the source since, which can also be downloaded from the Downloads tab above. The sample app shows you how to use the library by creating a ViewPager of images downloaded from the web. These are cached in the LruCache.

## Code

#### [The Ultimate Android Library](http://www.theultimateandroidlibrary.com/)
There's been a lot of talk about creating a site where all Android open source projects are collected and categorizes. [Alexandre Gherschon](https://plus.google.com/106334952054039890114) and [Christophe Versieux](https://plus.google.com/117418174673875366560) have stepped up to the challenge and created The Ultimate Android Library website and mobile app. Check it out, and make sure to send them information about any libraries that are missing from the collection.

#### [Basic ActionBar - Part 3](http://blog.stylingandroid.com/archives/1173)
[Mark Allison](https://plus.google.com/101161883485148457960) keeps going with his series on using the ActionBar. This time he discusses the list navigation mode.

#### [Discerning If User On A Phone, Tablet or Google TV](http://www.andreabaccega.com/blog/2012/08/24/discerning-if-the-user-is-using-your-android-app-from-a-phone-tablet-or-even-google-tv/)
[Andrea Baccega](https://plus.google.com/109217393200753135791) takes a look at the Google I/O Sched app and analyzes how it determines what type of device it's running on.

#### [Updates to UrlImageViewHelper](https://plus.google.com/103583939320326217147/posts/W17z124Zk5B)

#### [Thanks For The Memories](http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/2012/08/thanks-for-memories.html)
[Chet Haase](https://plus.google.com/104755487586666698979) discusses the importance of using the right size of bitmaps in your UI and the performance optimizations you need to be aware of. 

#### [Pin & Progress](https://plus.google.com/113735310430199015092/posts/TbCkqQN4AEk)
YAARNP (Yet Another Awesome [Roman Nurik](https://plus.google.com/113735310430199015092) Project)! He's released an open source project that demonstrates custom progress indicators similar to those in Google Play apps.

#### [Done & Discard](https://plus.google.com/113735310430199015092/posts/R49wVvcDoEW)
From [Roman Nurik](https://plus.google.com/113735310430199015092):
> There's a visual pattern in some system apps where the Up button is replaced by a Done button, optionally with an adjacent or overflow'd Discard negative action. I personally think this pattern works really well within the framework of—and in the spirit of—the guidelines, so I decided to open source some code showing how to do it.

#### [Undo Bar](https://plus.google.com/113735310430199015092/posts/RA9WEEGWYp6)
Again from [Roman Nurik](https://plus.google.com/113735310430199015092):
> As a follow up to yesterday's post (above) about Done and Discard, I realized we didn't have great sample code for an undo bar (ala Gmail). This is a bar that shows up after a potentially destructive or heavyweight action is performed (e.g. archiving or deleting an email) and briefly offers the ability to undo the most recent action.

#### [Know your resources: Integers and Booleans](http://www.androidzeitgeist.com/2012/08/know-your-resources-integers-and.html)

#### [AndroidAsync - a NIO socket and HTTP library for Android](https://plus.google.com/103583939320326217147/posts/4D9W7MqWNDV)
From [Koushik Dutta](https://plus.google.com/103583939320326217147):
>When I was writing [Tether](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.tether&hl=en) a while ago, I ended up needing a NIO library to handle the hundreds/thousands of connections being proxied through the Android device.
