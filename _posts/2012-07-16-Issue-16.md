## Open Source Project of the Week

#### [funf Open Sensing Framework](http://funf.media.mit.edu/index.html)
The Funf Open Sensing Framework is an extensible sensing and data processing framework for mobile devices, developed at the MIT Media Lab. The core concept is to provide an open source, reusable set of functionalities, enabling the collection, uploading, and configuration of a wide range of data types.

Key features include:

* Remote configuration.
* Many built-in data "probes" (see below).
* Automatic or manual data upload.
* Delay tolerant implementation - When internet connection is not available, caches data locally until server connection is restored.
* One-way hashing and encryption for sensitive data: Does not save any textual data or phone numbers in human-readable format.
* Encryption of locally stored database files.
* 3rd-party data input API allowing any app to leverage the Funf framework for collecting and storing arbitrary app data.
* Modular probe architecture allows for adding core data probes and modifying existing probe behavior.
* Basic survey system for manual data collection.
* Various optimizations for prolongig battery life and dealing with everyday use-cases (e.g. when SD card is not available because user is copying music files to it)
* Field proven - Deployed for over 15 months with over 100 users in an MIT living laboratory experiment.

#### [The I/O 2012 Android app source is now available](https://plus.google.com/113735310430199015092/posts/fQMrL4KzbXn)
From Roman Nurik:
> Every year a few of us Googlers spend a few [really long] weeks preparing an app for the conference. The app serves two primary purposes. The first is, of course, to help conference-goers find their way around Moscone and attend the sessions they find most interesting. The second, and arguably more important purpose of the app, is to serve as an open-source example of the Android team's latest and greatest Android development best-practices.

#### [Android UI in Action (Early Access Edition) by Neil Davies](http://manning.com/davies/)
<img src="http://manning.com/davies/davies_cover150.jpg" style="float: right;" /> 

In the mobile world, the user interface is the most crucial factor in an application's success or failure. Users are on the move, and they expect Android apps to be responsive, intuitive, and engaging. Good mobile user experiences blend classic design ideas with new mobile-specific techniques. And when you throw in the rich features Android makes available, like gestures, animations, and location awareness, there's a lot to learn.

*Android UI in Action* is a unique and practical book for designers and developers who want to create great user experiences on Android. It begins by surveying the Android UI landscape, covering views, positioning, style, and device-specific screen considerations. You'll learn both to understand the Android platform and how to use its rich capabilities to best advantage. Next, you'll take a step back and explore some mobile design patterns that define the best apps available for Android and other mobile devices. With all the core techniques in hand, you'll look at the features and effects that make great apps stand out. For example, you'll learn how to create custom components and layouts to create responsive and rich UIs. You'll use animation as more than just eye candy, and understand how to introduce cool gesture-driven controls. ([#](https://plus.google.com/110753107896469232101/posts/JEAzvzEvaWZ))
