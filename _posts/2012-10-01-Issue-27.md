#### [Tape](http://square.github.com/tape/)
Tape is a collection of queue-related classes for Android and Java by Square, Inc.

`QueueFile` is a lightning-fast, transactional, file-based FIFO. Addition and removal from an instance is an O(1) operation and is atomic. Writes are synchronous; data will be written to disk before an operation returns. The underlying file is structured to survive process and even system crashes and if an I/O exception is thrown during a mutating change, the change is aborted.

An `ObjectQueue` represents an ordering of arbitrary objects which can be backed either by the filesystem (via `QueueFile`) or in memory only.

`TaskQueue` is a special object queue which holds `Tasks`, objects which have a notion of being executed. Instances are managed by an external executor which prepares and executes enqueued tasks.
