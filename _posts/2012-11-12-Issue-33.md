#### [Refactoring Support for Android Resources](https://plus.google.com/116539451797396019960/posts/7c4sNqVnqMt)
[Tor Norbye](https://plus.google.com/116539451797396019960) writes that we're finally getting Android resource refactoring support.

## Open Source Projects of the Week

#### [SQLiteAssetHelper](https://github.com/jgilfelt/android-sqlite-asset-helper)
[Jeff Gilfelt](https://plus.google.com/104992412719307414985)'s library is a helper class to manage database creation and version management using an application's raw asset files.

>This class provides developers with a simple way to ship their Android app with an existing SQLite database (which may be pre-populated with data) and to manage its initial creation and any upgrades required with subsequent version releases.

> It is implemented as an extension to SQLiteOpenHelper, providing an efficient way for ContentProvider implementations to defer opening and upgrading the database until first use.
