## Tools

#### [Quality Tools for Android](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/Quality-Tools-for-Android)
[Stéphane Nicolas](https://plus.google.com/117469301043100028709) has put together a sample application for Android that shows how to set up a thorough testing environment for your own app. Here are some of the testing technologies included in the project:

* Standard Android testing framework and code coverage using emma, reported in Sonar. That also covers robotium, easy mock and mockito technologies.
* Robolectric testing framework and code coverage using Cobertura, reported in Sonar.
* UI Automator testing through a new android maven plugin goal (to be released in android-maven-plugin-3.5.2) and result in sonar.
* Configuration works out of the box in eclipse
* Lint integration via Maven.
* PMD, findbugs, checkstyle integration via Maven, reported in Sonar.
* [lint android maven lint](https://github.com/lewisd32/lint-maven-plugin) integration (pom checker)
* [Spoon from square](https://github.com/square/spoon)
* Testing  technologies integrated : 
    * Standard Android tests   
        * easymock
        * mockito
        * mockwebserver
        * robotium
    * robolectric tests
        * hamcrest 
        * easymock
        * mockito

What is missing: 

0. Using [Jacoco instead of emma](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/pull/64#issuecomment-12150910) would help getting more standard Sonar config 
1. get aggregated tests and code coverage 
2. get monkey through Maven, [using this technique](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3968064/ideas-for-automating-android-monkey-runs) get the results in Sonar
3. When finished, use the [sonar android lint plugin](https://github.com/jeromevdl/sonar-android-lint-plugin) 
4. FEST Android should be included as well (thx to Jake Wharton for pointing this out).

#### [DevAppsDirect](http://www.inappsquared.com/devappsdirect.html)
[Kenneth Lewelling](https://plus.google.com/116554403664382634608)
has released a tool to find great Android libraries, experience them with the Virtual Installer and get inspired. Exciting and innovative libraries exist that can help you create an app your users will love. This app make discovering and evaluating these libraries as easy as pressing a button. Watch our video to see how.

## Open Source Project of the Week

#### [Butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife)
[Jake Wharton](https://plus.google.com/108284392618554783657) has created a view "injection" library for Android which uses annotation processing to generate code that does direct field assignment of your views. This library works well alongside Square's [Dagger](http://square.github.com/dagger/). Here's an example of what it can do:

    class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
      @InjectView(R.id.title) TextView title;
      @InjectView(R.id.subtitle) TextView subtitle;
      @InjectView(R.id.footer) TextView footer;

      @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.simple_activity);
        Views.inject(this);
        // TODO Use "injected" views...
      }
    }

[Mario Zechner](https://plus.google.com/102416766951447222370) of BadLogic games (and libgdx) writes an examination of the state of cross platform game development via the JVM.

#### [RoboDemo](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/RoboDemo)
RoboDemo is a showcase library for Android by [Stéphane Nicolas](https://plus.google.com/117469301043100028709) to demonstrate to users how a given Activity works.

There are some cases where applications require more complex interactions from users, or new interactions not covered by Android UI Guidelines.

RoboDemo eases creating showcases / explaining / demonstrating of such activities to users. It will display an overlay activity to illustrate the Activity under showcase. The explanations consist of a serie of points to click on and their associated labels. The Activity under showcase is dimmed and the showcase highlights transparent areas to point views or positions users have to click.
