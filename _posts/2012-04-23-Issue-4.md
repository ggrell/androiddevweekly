## Open Source Project of the Week

####[ActionBar Sherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/)
<img style="float:right; margin:1em;" src="http://androiddevweekly.com/images/actionbar_sherlock_mascot.png" />
ActionBarSherlock is an extension of the compatibility library designed to facilitate the use of the action bar design pattern across all versions of Android with a single API.

The library will automatically use the native action bar when appropriate or will automatically wrap a custom implementation around your layouts. This allows you to easily develop an application with an action bar for every version of Android from 2.x and up.
