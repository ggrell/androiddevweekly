#### [Update on Tablet App Guidelines and Screenshots](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/04/update-on-tablet-app-guidelines-and.html)
More and more, developers are investing in a full tablet experience for their apps and seeing those investments pay off big. Starting today, it’s even easier to show off those tablet apps to users and to understand what it takes to make a great tablet app. You’re now able to upload screenshots of your app running on 7” and 10” tablets to the Google Play Developer Console, and those screenshots are shown preferentially in Google Play to users on those devices.

#### [Firefox for Android’s UI polishing Hackathon](http://lucasr.org/2013/04/22/firefox-for-androids-ui-polishing-hackathon/)
As an experiment, the Firefox team will be doing a hackathon this week from Wednesday to Friday and they’re going to focus on UI polishing bugs—those UI papercuts that are not so prominent in isolation but, when fixed en masse, make a whole lot of difference. So, you can start nominating Fennec bugs for the hackathon now by tagging them with “ui-hackathon”.

As usual, everyone is welcome to participate. You can help by tagging bugs, or better yet, fixing them. Have a look at the wiki page for more details on the agenda.

## Open Source Project of the Week

#### [http-request](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/http-request)
This library was written to make HTTP requests simple and easy when using a `HttpURLConnection`.

Libraries like [Apache HttpComponents](http://hc.apache.org) are great but sometimes
for either simplicity, or perhaps for the environment you are deploying to Android,
you just want to use a good old-fashioned `HttpURLConnection`.  This library seeks
to add convenience and common patterns to the act of making HTTP requests such as
a fluid-interface for building requests and support for features such as multipart
requests.

**Bottom line:** The single goal of this library is to improve the usability of the
`HttpURLConnection` class.
