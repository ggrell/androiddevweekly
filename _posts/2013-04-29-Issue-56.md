#### [Tablet Optimization Tips in the Google Play Developer Console](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/04/tablet-optimization-tips-in-google-play.html)
Last week Google updated their guidelines for making great tablet apps and added the ability to upload tablet screenshots that are shown preferentially in Google Play to users on those devices. Today they’re introducing a new Optimization Tips page in the Google Play Developer Console that lets you quickly see how your app is doing against basic guidelines for tablet app distribution and quality.

#### [PagerSlidingTabStrip](https://github.com/astuetz/PagerSlidingTabStrip)
This is a new implementation of an interactive paging indicator widget by [Andreas Stütz](https://plus.google.com/117122118961369445953), compatible with the ViewPager from the Android Support Library. It also duplicates the look and feel of the new tab strip in the latest Google Play app, and includes the animation seen when moving between pages.

#### [Handling Configuration Changes with Fragments](http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/2013/04/retaining-objects-across-config-changes.html)
This post by [Alex Lockwood](https://plus.google.com/100751609891157863386) addresses a common question: what is the best way to retain active objects—such as running Threads, Sockets, and AsyncTasks—across device configuration changes?

To answer this question, he discusses some of the common difficulties developers face when using long-running background tasks in conjunction with the Activity lifecycle. Then, he describes the flaws of two common approaches to solving the problem. Finally, he concludes with sample code illustrating the recommended solution, which uses retained Fragments to achieve the goal.

#### [How to notify your Fragment of different user navigation events](http://envyandroid.com/archives/843/android-fragment-back-button)
If you are using Android Fragments in your app, it can sometimes be useful to know when a user is navigation away from your fragment so that you can act upon the users action, either by saving away data, asking the user for a confirmation.

If you're interested in using the open source computer vision library in your Android app, here's a set of steps for compiling it using the NDK.

## Design

#### [UX APPRENTICE](http://www.uxapprentice.com/)
Tools like Balsamiq make it easier than ever to participate in the design of user interfaces, and that’s a great thing. The problem, as you may have already discovered, is that creating products that are easy to use is actually quite hard!

Information architecture, interaction design, and copywriting are just a few of the elements involved. There’s a lot of art and science behind creating a lovable user interface.

This site is designed to teach you the basics with an easy process to follow, and pointers for where to learn more. The process illustrated has three layers: Discovery, Strategy and Design.

#### [Android Developer Icons Font Set](http://www.spiderflystudios.com/?portfolio=android-dev-icons-the-font/)
Does your Android app have a lot of icons used in it? Thought about adding some icons to your app to up the visual appeal factor? Here is a new way in which you can do just that. Displaying the icons you wish is now as simple as displaying a custom font within your app. We painstakingly spend an entire day converting the many dev icons into a set of high res fonts that are scalable to any size you need. Now you don’t have to worry about the hassle of drawables. The best part is that the font files are extremely small, only 11kb each for a total of 22kb! Want to have different colored icons? Now its as simple as changing the color of the font to any color you want. Its that easy!

#### [Cognitive Overhead, Or Why Your Product Isn’t As Simple As You Think](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/20/cognitive-overhead/)
David Lieb, co-founder and CEO of Bump, discusses the trend towards "simplification" in design of software and hardware products.

## Books

#### [Beginning NFC: Near-Field Communication with Arduino, Android, and PhoneGap](http://amzn.to/15ecJkh)
<img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=144930852X&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=trickybits-20" style="float: right; margin: 1em;" /> 

NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a protocol for the contactless exchange of data between devices (such as the Android-powered Nexus S) and/or certain kinds of tags. NFC also interoperates with certain RFID tags such as the Mifare tags. Where the fun begins is when you throw hobbyist hardware into the mix. The inexpensive ($30) SonMicro RFID reader/writer, when paired with an equally inexpensive antenna, gives you the ability to encode custom messages on RFID tags that you can later read by tapping the tags against your phone. This book shows how you can exchange data between Android, Arduino, and Processing using NFC and RFID.
