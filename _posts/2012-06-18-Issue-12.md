#### [Google Play Store Now Allows Developers To Reply To Reviews](http://androidspin.com/2012/06/14/developers-can-now-reply-to-reviews-in-the-play-store/)
According to Android Police, Google Play is rolling out an update that will allow developers to respond to app comments. Initially it will only be available for those with the "Top Developer" badge, but hopefully soon it will roll out to everyone else as well.

#### [The #1 Grossing Game On Android And iOS Has Almost Even Revenues From Both](http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/13/the-1-grossing-game-on-android-and-ios-denas-rage-of-bahamut-has-almost-even-revenues-from-both/)
> Here’s some promising news about Android monetization. DeNA says that Rage of Bahamut, which was the #1 grossing game on both Android and iOS yesterday, is earning about the same revenue per day from both platforms. It’s a single data point, but it goes against recent studies from companies like Flurry that say that Android lags behind in terms of monetization by a factor of 4-to-1. “Contrary to what we read, we’ve been very happy with Android monetization,” DeNA director and Ngmoco CEO Neil Young says. “There is not a big discrepancy between the two now.”

## Open Source Project of the Week

#### [basic-http-client](http://code.google.com/p/basic-http-client/)
Last year, the Android team recommended the use of java.net.HttpURLConnection instead of Apache HttpClient for Gingerbread and up. Unfortunately, HttpURLConnection is a lower-level API, so now everyone has to do their own URL encoding, set MIME type application/x-www-form-urlencoded, read InputStream and ErrorStream, wrap with try/catch, finally close streams, etc.

Rather than write all that code one-off for each request, I’ve created a basic HTTP client which lets you easily

* make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
* make asynchronous requests with automatic retries and exponential backoff
* customize requests using a RequestHandler
* automatically wrap requests in an AsyncTask (Android-specific)

It has a very simple API, and the jar weighs in at only 40kB (basic) or 45kb (Android), including source. It is Android-independent by design, although Android developers will find it especially useful.

More details available on this [blog post](http://turbomanage.wordpress.com/2012/06/12/a-basic-http-client-for-android-and-more/).

#### [HttpResponseCache](https://github.com/candrews/HttpResponseCache)
HttpResponseCache is available on Android 4.0+, so this library exists to support older versions of Android. It should work well with the basic-http-client implementation.

If you're adding Subscriptions to your Android app and having trouble using the Web API to check if a sub is valid make sure that:

- You are authenticating against the API with the same Play Store merchant account as you published your app from
- You've followed the [Auth docs](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/authorization) and using the Web Server Auth flow
